<h1>Welcome to Nova Horizon <br><br></h1>
    <h3>Brought to you by the Nova Team <br><br>
    
    Nova Horizon is a game we've been passionately developing for a long timeâ€”and we're still hard at work refining it. The game features a highly advanced crafting and mining system, <br>as well as a robust trading and selling economy that enhances the overall player experience.
    Explore a wide variety of planets,<br> including unique locations like the Planetarium. From vast cave systems to expansive lakes and oceans, Nova Horizon has it all.
    Thank you for joining us on this journey.

    Sincerely, <br>
    The Nova Team</h3>
